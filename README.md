# Model-Free Deep Reinforcement Learning for Flappy Bird in OpenAI Gym

## Objective:
Train an agent to play Flappy Bird using a model-free Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method within an OpenAI Gym-like environment.

---

## Key Tasks:

### 1. Set up the Flappy Bird Environment
- Identify a suitable Flappy Bird environment, such as [gym-flappy-bird](https://github.com/chaneyk/gym-flappy-bird) or any equivalent GitHub repository that provides the game as an OpenAI Gym-compatible environment.
- Install the environment and validate that it works by running a basic random agent.

---

### 2. Choose a Model-Free DRL Algorithm
- Select a suitable DRL algorithm:
  - **Deep Q-Networks (DQN)**: Good for discrete action spaces (Flap/No-Flap).
  - **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**: Robust and widely used for DRL.
  - **Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)**: Ensures stable training.
- For Flappy Bird, **DQN** is a straightforward choice due to the discrete action space.

---

### 3. Implement the Agent
- Use a popular DRL framework such as **Stable-Baselines3** for implementation.
- The agent will interact with the environment, learning through trial and error using the chosen DRL algorithm.

---

### 4. Define Training Strategy
- **Hyperparameters**:
  - Learning rate: \(1e-3\)
  - Discount factor (\(\gamma\)): \(0.99\)
  - Exploration strategy: Start with high exploration (\(\epsilon\)) and gradually reduce it (epsilon-greedy policy for DQN).
  - Reward shaping: Encourage progress (e.g., reward for passing pipes, penalize crashes).
- **Exploration Strategy**:
  - For DQN: Use an epsilon-decay strategy for exploration-exploitation trade-off.
- **Reward Shaping**:
  - Positive reward for passing pipes.
  - Negative reward for crashing.
  - No reward for hovering without progress.

---

### 5. Train and Evaluate the Agent
- Train the agent over multiple episodes.
- Evaluate the performance:
  - Metrics:
    - Average game score over several episodes.
    - Number of pipes passed per episode.
    - Success rate (episodes with high scores).

---

## Deliverables
- A trained agent model file (e.g., `flappybird_dqn.zip`).
- Scripts for training and evaluating the agent.
- A performance report summarizing:
  - Total rewards across episodes.
  - Learning curve (e.g., rewards vs. episodes graph).

This framework can be extended to experiment with different DRL algorithms or hyperparameter tuning.
